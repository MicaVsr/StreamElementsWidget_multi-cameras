# StreamElementsWidget Multi-cameras
### [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com/) + [OBS Ninja](https://obs.ninja/) custom widget to add multiple cameras to your overlay.

This widget was created to make a common stream overlay to share with other streamers since we wanted to do an event and give all the guests the ability to broadcast it without having to set up an overlay with all the cameras themselves.

## Add the widget
To add this widget, you should select the "Custom Widget" option and copy-paste the corresponding code in each tab.

Then, the widget has some settings you can edit without modify the code:

*The most important setting here is the OBS Ninja link, here goes the link that this platform provide to, usually, add the camera to the OBS program as a Browser source.*
